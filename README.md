# Masterarbeit (master thesis)

## General Description

This is the code for the analyses I performed throughout my master thesis at Technische Universit√§t Berlin with the title: 

*Fairness in Algorithms as Technical Problem. A Techno-Sociological Review of Fairness Implentations & Anti-Discrimination Techniques in the Context of Machine Learning*
(Fairness in Algorithmen als technisches Problem. Eine techniksoziologische Betrachtung von Fairness-Implementationen & Anti-Diskriminierungs-Techniken im Kontext Maschinellen Lernens)

## Instructions for Reproducing

1. Firstly, read (!) and run the "initialization.Rmd" script. This should guarantee that R and its packages as well as Python and its packages are installed and working. Depending on the OS of the user, different parts of the script have to be executed, therefore it's quite important to read the instructions :D
